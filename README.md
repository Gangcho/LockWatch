# LockWatch
Display watch faces on your lockscreen - inspired by Apple Watch

## Description
LockWatch is back! And this time it's better than ever before! This tweak allows you to display watchfaces on your iOS lockscreen inspired by Apple Watch.

Every watch face is recreated 1:1 and can be configured either by force-touching them (as seen on Apple Watch) or the optional dedicated configuration app.

## Available watch faces
* Numerals 
* Utility 
* Simple 
* Color 
* Chronograph
* X-Large

## Localizations
You can help contributing to this project again by adding various localizations (English and German will be included by default). Just fork the "Localization" branch (if that works, I don't know yet), add your Localization if it's not on the list below, and submit a pull request.

** Completed localizations **

* English 
* German

## Plugins
Just like the previous version of LockWatch, this tweak is extensible. In fact, the stock watch faces are just plugins. There will be a plugin API and a template to create your own watch faces.

## Compatibility
This version of LockWatch will only be compatible with iOS 10 at first, with iOS 9 (and maybe iOS 8) compatibility being added at a later point.
Compiling requires iOS 10.2 SDK

## Info
This project contains an additional "Single View Application" target called "Build". It is required to allow Code Completion in a project using only an External Build System. It is not possible to build this target, so leave it at its place.
